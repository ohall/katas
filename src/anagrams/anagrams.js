/**
 * Anagrams Kata
 * 
 * Write a function that detects if two strings are anagrams of each other.
 * An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
 * using all the original letters exactly once.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - "listen" and "silent" are anagrams
 * - "hello" and "world" are not anagrams
